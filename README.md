"Cleantech-Transforming Waste management using transfer learning"

CleanTech WasteWise is a simple web-based application designed to help classify different types of garbage waste such as **plastic**, **glass**, **metal**, **paper**, **cardboard**, and **trash**. The project aims to promote efficient waste sorting and awareness using a structured dataset for classification.


 🌍 Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of a SmartBridge internship to demonstrate basic front-end design combined with a real-world dataset involving waste classification. It helps users understand how different waste materials are categorized and how digital tools can assist in environmental sustainability.

 💻 Features

- A clean and responsive HTML interface (`index.html`)
- Integrated waste classification dataset with image folders:
  - `plastic/`
  - `glass/`
  - `metal/`
  - `paper/`
  - `cardboard/`
  - `trash/`
- Ready for enhancement with machine learning or image classification in future
